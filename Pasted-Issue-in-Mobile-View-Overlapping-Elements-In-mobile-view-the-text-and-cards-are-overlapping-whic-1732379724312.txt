Issue in Mobile View
Overlapping Elements:

In mobile view, the text and cards are overlapping, which disrupts readability (e.g., the text "Mine Two Chains at Once" overlaps with the Bitcoin and Elastos cards).
Improper Scaling:

The size and placement of text, icons, and graphics aren't scaling proportionally for the smaller mobile viewport.
The spacing between components (e.g., icons, cards, and connecting dotted lines) becomes compressed.
Cluttered Layout:

The mobile layout feels crowded, with insufficient spacing around key elements. This impacts usability and visual clarity.
Solution for Fixing the Issues
Text Placement and Hierarchy:

Adjust the position of the heading "Mine Two Chains at Once" so it does not overlap with other elements.
Use a flexbox or grid layout to ensure the heading dynamically adjusts its position.
Add padding above and below the heading to prevent overlap.
Responsive Scaling:

Use media queries to define specific styles for mobile breakpoints (e.g., 320px to 768px width).
Scale down the size of text, icons, and cards proportionally for smaller screens.
Ensure consistent padding and margins between all elements to avoid a cramped feel.
Card Layout Adjustment:

Stack the Bitcoin and Elastos cards vertically in mobile view, rather than placing them side by side.
This allows each card to have sufficient space without overlapping.
Keep the connecting "Security" and "Rewards" dotted lines between them, but adjust their alignment for the vertical layout.
Spacing and Padding:

Increase the spacing between the cards and dotted lines in mobile view.
Ensure that the text inside the cards doesnâ€™t exceed their boundaries (add overflow: hidden; or similar CSS properties).
Test Across Devices:

Test the layout using tools like Google Chrome DevTools, BrowserStack, or real devices to ensure the design is responsive across various screen sizes and orientations.
