Issues Noted:
Overlap Between Cards and Labels:

The Bitcoin-Level Security label overlaps with the "Bitcoin" and "Elastos" cards in mobile view, which clutters the layout and disrupts readability.
Spacing Between Elements:

The dotted lines (for Security and Rewards) and their labels feel too compressed against the cards and icons. This reduces clarity and creates a crowded appearance.
Alignment Issues:

The text and icons within the cards aren't perfectly aligned (e.g., "BTC Rewards" icon and text are slightly misaligned compared to "ELA Rewards").
The dotted lines do not center perfectly between the cards, especially noticeable in mobile view.
Vertical Space Utilization:

While improvements have been made, the layout still appears a bit squished. Thereâ€™s room to expand vertical spacing to create better breathing room.
Instructions for Your Engineer:
Fix Label Overlap:

Move the Bitcoin-Level Security label below the dotted lines instead of overlapping the cards.
Add padding above and below the label to separate it from other elements.
Example:

css
Copy code
.security-label {
  margin-top: 10px; /* Adjust for spacing above */
  margin-bottom: 20px; /* Create separation below */
  text-align: center; /* Keep it centered in mobile view */
}
Increase Spacing Between Elements:

Add more vertical spacing between:
Dotted lines and the cards.
The labels ("Security" and "Rewards") and their respective dotted lines.
Adjust the height or margins of the dotted lines to better center them between the cards.
Example:

css
Copy code
.dotted-lines {
  margin: 15px 0; /* Add vertical spacing */
  justify-content: center; /* Center between cards */
}
Align Text and Icons:

Ensure text and icons within the Bitcoin and Elastos cards are vertically aligned.
Use a flexbox with align-items: center for consistent alignment.
Example:

css
Copy code
.card-content {
  display: flex;
  align-items: center;
  gap: 8px; /* Space between icon and text */
}
Optimize for Mobile View:

Test on smaller breakpoints (e.g., 320px width) to ensure the cards and elements do not overlap.
Use media queries to scale down the card width and font sizes for smaller screens.
Example:

css
Copy code
@media (max-width: 768px) {
  .cards {
    flex-direction: column; /* Stack cards vertically */
    align-items: center;
  }

  .card {
    width: 90%; /* Scale card width */
    margin-bottom: 20px; /* Add spacing between stacked cards */
  }

  .dotted-lines {
    margin: 10px auto; /* Center lines in mobile */
  }
}
Test for Responsiveness:

Test the layout on multiple device sizes (320px, 480px, 768px) to ensure no overlapping or misaligned elements.
Confirm that the dotted lines, labels, and cards maintain their spacing and alignment across devices.
Expected Outcome:
Clear separation between cards, labels, and dotted lines.
Consistent alignment for icons, text, and visual elements.
Smooth, uncluttered layout in both desktop and mobile views.
